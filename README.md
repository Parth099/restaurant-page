# restaurant-page
'Project: Restaurant Page' is from TOP(The odin Project). It is a basic intro to Wepback. 
It shows a strong grasp of Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation as all 'tabs' are created by Javascript.


## What is Webpack?!
It is simply a module bundler. It does more however, for example it takes all the code in all dependant JS files and minifies them; Making a single file for the brower to use. This speeds up the loading and allows the abstraction to do the heavy lifting for you.
